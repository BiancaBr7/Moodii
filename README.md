# Moodii — Voice-Based Mood Tracking App

Moodii is a voice-driven mood tracking app designed to help users reflect on their emotional state by speaking their feelings aloud. Unlike traditional mood trackers that rely on emojis or sliders, Moodii listens deeply — analyzing tone, pace, and rhythm to provide a more empathetic, human-centered experience.
